<!-- Write a program in php to calculate and print the electricity bill of a given customer. The customer ID, name, and unit consumed by the user should be captured from the keyboard to display the total amount to be paid to the customer.

The charge are as follow :

Unit	Charge/unit
upto 199	@1.20
200 and above but less than 400	@1.50
400 and above but less than 600	@1.80
600 and above	@2.00
If bill exceeds Rs. 400 then a surcharge of 15% will be charged and the minimum bill should be of Rs. 100/-

Test Data :
1001
James
800
Expected Output :
Customer IDNO :1001
Customer Name :James
unit Consumed :800
Amount Charges @Rs. 2.00 per unit : 1600.00
Surchage Amount : 240.00
Net Amount Paid By the Customer : 1840.00

} else {
    $chargePerUnit = 2.00;
}

// Calculate the total charge before surcharge
$totalCharge = $unitsConsumed * $chargePerUnit;

// Check if the total charge exceeds Rs. 400 and apply surcharge
if ($totalCharge > 400) {
    $surcharge = 0.15 * $totalCharge;
} else {
    $surcharge = 0;

// Calculate the net amount to be paid by the customer
$netAmount = $totalCharge + $surcharge;

// Ensure the minimum bill is Rs. 100
if ($netAmount < 100) {
    $netAmount = 100;
}

// Display the customer's bill
echo "Customer IDNO: $customerId\n";

echo "Unit Consumed: $unitsConsumed\n";
echo "Amount Charges @Rs. $chargePerUnit per unit: " . number_format($totalCharge, 2) . "\n";
echo "Surcharge Amount: " . number_format($surcharge, 2) . "\n";
echo "Net Amount Paid By the Customer: " . number_format($netAmount, 2);

<!-- In this program:

We accept the customer's ID, name, and units consumed.

Based on the units consumed, we determine the charge per unit according to the provided criteria.

We calculate the total charge before applying the surcharge.

If the total charge exceeds Rs. 400, we apply a surcharge of 15% on the total charge; otherwise, the surcharge is zero.

We calculate the net amount to be paid by adding the total charge and surcharge. We also ensure that the minimum bill is Rs. 100.

Finally, we display the customer's details and the calculated bill, including the total charge, surcharge, and net amount to be paid.

For the provided test data, the program will output the expected result, including the customer's ID, name, unit consumption, charges, surcharge, and net amount paid. -->
