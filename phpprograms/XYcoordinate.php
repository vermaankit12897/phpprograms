<!-- Certainly! Here's a PHP program that accepts a coordinate point (x, y) in an XY coordinate system and determines in which quadrant the coordinate point lies:

<?php
// Accept the values of x and y
$x = 7;
$y = 9;

// Determine the quadrant based on the values of x and y
if ($x > 0 && $y > 0) {
    echo "The coordinate point ($x,$y) lies in the First quadrant.";
} elseif ($x < 0 && $y > 0) {
    echo "The coordinate point ($x,$y) lies in the Second quadrant.";
} elseif ($x < 0 && $y < 0) {
    echo "The coordinate point ($x,$y) lies in the Third quadrant.";
} elseif ($x > 0 && $y < 0) {
    echo "The coordinate point ($x,$y) lies in the Fourth quadrant.";
} else {
    echo "The coordinate point ($x,$y) is on an axis.";
}

<!-- In this program:

We accept the values of x and y. For the provided test data, x is 7, and y is 9.

We use an if-elseif-else structure to determine the quadrant based on the values of x and y.

If x is greater than 0 and y is greater than 0, the point lies in the First quadrant.

If x is less than 0 and y is greater than 0, the point lies in the Second quadrant.

If x is less than 0 and y is less than 0, the point lies in the Third quadrant.

If x is greater than 0 and y is less than 0, the point lies in the Fourth quadrant.

If none of the conditions are met, it means the point is on one of the coordinate axes.

For the provided test data (7, 9), the program will output: "The coordinate point (7,9) lies in the First quadrant." -->
